=============
In order to run this project you need the following:

- A Mac with XCode installed on it.

Step 1: Import the project with Xcode
step 2: Import the Graphics & Elements 2 folder in the project.
Step 3: Go to properties and remove any links that are red (probably not needed).

It should be possible to compile and run now.
